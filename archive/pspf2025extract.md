# Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) 2025

## Purpose and Applicability

- Sets minimum security standards for Australian Government entities to safeguard people, information, and assets domestically and internationally.
- Mandatory for non-corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act).
- State, territory, and non-government organisations may also be required to implement parts of the framework.


## Structure of the PSPF

- **Principles:** Applied across all aspects of protective security.
- **Domains:** The six key, interconnected security domains.
- **Policy:** Mandatory standards and requirements under each domain.
- **Standards \& Technical Manuals:** Mandatory instructions for specific security areas.
- **Guidelines:** Supplementary best practices.


## The Six Security Domains

### 1. Governance

- Appointment of Chief Security Officer (CSO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
- Governance accountability, reporting, and roles/responsibilities.
- Annual compliance reporting to Ministers and Department of Home Affairs.


### 2. Risk

- Security risk management processes aligned with enterprise risk.
- Documentation of risk tolerance, risk ownership, and sharing of identified risks.
- Management of third-party, supply chain, and foreign interference risks.


### 3. Information

- Protective markings, classifications (OFFICIAL, PROTECTED, SECRET, TOP SECRET).
- Need-to-know principle and secure handling requirements.
- Recordkeeping, secure information sharing, and disposal protocols.


### 4. Technology

- Mandatory security assessment and authorisation for technology assets.
- Policies for handling emerging tech (AI, quantum computing, connected devices).
- Cybersecurity strategy with zero trust culture, cloud security, and gateway protections.
- Essential Eight mitigation strategies and ongoing cyber threat intelligence sharing.


### 5. Personnel

- Pre-employment screening and ongoing suitability checks.
- Security clearance processes and conditional clearance management.
- Vetting of staff, eligibility waivers, temporary and remote access protocols.


### 6. Physical

- Security planning and zone requirements for entity facilities.

- Controls on access, technical surveillance, and asset disposal.


## Key 2025 Changes and Highlights

- Stronger mandate for CISO role, with explicit reporting to Audit Committees.
- New requirements for AI, quantum technology, and connected peripherals.
- Cloud and infrastructure hosting must be on certified providers under the Australian Government Hosting Certification Framework.
- New cyber programs: mandatory participation in ASD partnership, real-time threat intelligence sharing, and special protections for "Systems of Government Significance."
- Updated eligibility waiver and temporary access rules for security clearances.
